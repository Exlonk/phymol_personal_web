<p>I am a recent graduate from the Faculty of Exacts and Natural Sciences, where I earned my Bachelor's Degree. During my academic years, I was an active member of the Theoretical Chemical Physics investigation group for four years where I honed my skills in computational simulations and laboratory experience. I had the opportunity to serve as a monitor of the Lab Chemical Physics, further consolidating my expertise in this area.</p>
<br></br>
<p>With a strong background in natural sciences and four years of experience working as a member of the Theoretical Chemical Physics, I decided to expand my knowledge into the field of data science by completing the IBM Data Science Specialization on Coursera, as well as taking various other courses in machine learning. Through these courses, I have gained expertise in data analysis frameworks such as Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn, as well as deep learning frameworks like Keras. I am also familiar with the Dash framework, which I have used to create interactive dashboards.</p>
<br></br>
<p>In addition to my technical skills, I have also gained knowledge in HTML, CSS, and other web development technologies. This has allowed me to create visually appealing and interactive dashboards that can be used to convey insights to a wide range of stakeholders.</p>
<br></br>
<p>I am confident that my education and four years of experience working as a member of the Theoretical Chemical Physics, have equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in the field of data science. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my passion for science, technology, and innovation to a challenging and dynamic work environment. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications and how I can contribute to your organization.</p>
